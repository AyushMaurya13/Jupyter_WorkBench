# 🧪 Jupyter Workbench

Welcome to my **Jupyter Workbench** — a personal space where I practice and explore data science, Python, and machine learning concepts using Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📘 About

This repository is **not a polished project collection**, but rather a **practice space** where I:

- Experiment with Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`
- Learn new concepts through hands-on coding
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Test machine learning algorithms
- Practice data preprocessing and visualization
